Non-Profit Finder is a third-party API powered not-for-profit financial data application that provides the user information about randomly chosen not-for-profits based on a user's search parameters. By a user selecting a state, zipcode, or keyword search, the application accesses the Charity Navigator API, retrieves background data about ten randomly chosen not-for-profits selected by the search and stores the last five cities searched for later review.

I designed this application to experiment with different features of Materialize CSS and demonstrate proficiency of third-party API usage.

Key Features:

API call to Charity Navigation providing a randomly generated list of ten not-for-profits (based on JQuery coding)

Local storage functionality allowing the user to enter and retrieve up to five most recent searches at any time for later reference.

Please see deployed application at: https://willv1.github.io/charity-finder/index.html.
